This is the code for the development of a future website, that revolves around finances and investments. 
I hope to be able to create a free and better financing and money allocation website that rivals the leading companies. 
During my time in college, this code will be available to be seen, however, once I'm out it will become private. 
This website will most likely end up using Postgres, Django, python, and react as the main form of this website
